    <strong>Learn how to build and train a neural network in Python from scratch.</strong><br/>
    This project goes further by teaching how a network can convert any 8-bit binary number into its corresponding decimal value.

## Objective

The goal of this project is to:
- Understand how artificial neurons, layers, and neural networks work.
- Implement all components of a neural network (no external libraries).
- Train the network to map 8-bit binary inputs to decimal values (from 0 to 255).
